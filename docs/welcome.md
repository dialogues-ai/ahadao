## General Community Beleifs
There has been a lot of early scams and hacks with Web3. It is a place for self-titled degenerates.

But that has been its early reputation. Web3 has a real place in the world.

It won’t be a place for people to find salvation, or make enormous fortunes. It’s possible for the same, mundane life to continue, and I think that’s what people will want and need.

**Web3 offers:**
1. Societies become stabler
2. Currencies become stronger (and possibly more variant to represent different value exchanges)
3. The institutions that lie at the core of our every day underpinnings, disband, and are disallowed. People come to make the agreements between one another, person to person, and those third-party moderators are cut out of the picture (like banks and ads).


## Communal Effort
The lack of communal effort is something I feel like we’re seeing in a societal level. It’s a trend of atomization among us all this century, but the past few years especially, as our social lives made a huge shift. It seems like we’ve forgotten how to be around each other, even this far after the start of the pandemic.

4 parts:
- Help people get on board with web3
- Talk about it on a structural level
- Talk about applications of it in industry
- Talk about art hacks in general
    - Artist visions
    - Art engineering
    - Artists using technology
    - Artists in communities

It’s important not to conform to an idea of what we think would be cool, but to do exactly what we are interested in. That is how this group can be successful.

## Host a Talk

This DAO is about sharing information. Setup your own lecture/talk/art-share, and let people know about it.

We would love to see, and be part of, a self-growing, self-starting community.
