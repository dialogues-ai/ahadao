# Welcome! 

The Art Hackers Alliance is a DAO founded by 3 ATX natives who represented Technology, Art, and Literature and saw the potential for a paradigm shift in the social/technological environment around Web3 technologies designed to empower local creators.

Web3 is a global technological phenomenon that is already making it possible for many artists and other creators to connect to their respective communities. 

Art Hacker Alliance will facilitate meetings to enable community members to connect with one another around current subjects in Web3 and the arts, with the goal of cross-pollination between the various creative, artistic, and technical skillsets attendees will represent.

## General Community Values
There have been a lot of early scams and hacks with Web3. It is a place for self-titled degenerates, but alongside the financially-motivated masses, there are many artists and creators who have found that it is possible to create closer connections to collectors and other community supporters for their work.

Web3 has been a bit of a gold rush, it is true. But that has been its early reputation. Web3 has a real place in the world because it helps us connect with each other. Art Hackers Alliance members believe that inclusivity and collaboration will help to build a rewarding community.

Web3 won’t really be a place for people to find salvation, or make enormous fortunes. It'll be a place where individuals have more control over what they do online and for us all to exercise ownership over our data. Art Hackers Alliance will provide a forum to help people learn the basics and begin to apply Web3 technologies to their own creative enterprise.

**Web3 offers:**
1. Things are transparent and public
2. Currencies become more specialized - i.e., social tokens or tokens for community projects
3. Trusted middlemen become unnecessary


## Communal Effort
It seems like we’ve forgotten how to be around each other, even this far after the start of the pandemic.

4 part solution brought to you by AHA:
- Help people get on board with web3
- Talk about Web3 tech and how to use it on a structural level
- Talk about applications of Web3 in industries
- Talk about art hacking in general
    - Artist visions
    - Art engineering
    - Artists using technology
    - Artists in communities

It’s important not to conform to an idea of what we think would be cool, but to do exactly what we are interested in. That is how this group can be successful.

## Host a Talk

This DAO is about sharing information. Setup your own lecture/talk/art-share, and let people know about it.

We would love to see, and be part of, a self-growing, self-starting community.
